# Carbon

Carbon is a simple, universal and open-source tabletop roleplaying game, tailored mostly towards newer players and light, freeform-like play.
Downloads and more info are available on Carbon's webpage: https://carbon.francois.homps.fr.

## Modifying Carbon

Carbon's game manual and character sheet are entirely web-based, making them easy to edit.

1. Clone Carbon's Git repository: ``git clone https://github.com/FHomps/Carbon``. If unsure what Git is, ask the nearest friendly programmer.
2. Open the cloned repository in the editing suite of your choice (I recommend Visual Studio Code)
3. Start a webserver in Carbon's repository. This can be done trivially using VS Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
4. Edit Carbon's html and CSS files to your liking; you will see changes appear live on your browser of choice.
5. To render the manual and character sheets, print them as PDFs from your browser. I recommend Google Chrome for this, which I found has a better PDF rendering engine.

All contributions are welcome in the form of issues and pull requests.

Happy playing!
